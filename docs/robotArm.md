# Robotic Arm

## Introduction
<br>

A robotic arm is the most commonly used tool in robotics and is actively exploited in a vast number of industrial applications. Therefore, understanding its working principles, including forward kinematics and motion planning, is crucial for beginning learners. In this playground, they can control a cross-platform manipulator with five degrees of freedom. Users can as well customize the speed, bandwidth and appearance of the arm. The simulation demonstrates its transition from the original position to the target configuration with specified parameters.
