# Projectile Motion

## Introduction
<br>

This playground demonstrates the 3d motion of the balls shot out from the source located above the ground surface. Projectile dynamics takes into account the pitch angle and the height of the source as well as the projectile velocity. After the user set the parameters, the simulation generates a curved path, which is the combination of parabolas and straight lines, under the action of specified gravity. The introduced demo is a good start in studying ballistics and more complex problems such as the behaviour of the bullets, unguided bombs and rockets.
