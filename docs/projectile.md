# Projectile Motion

## Introduction
<br>

**Projectile motion** is the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a **projectile**, and its path is called its **trajectory**[[1]](#physics_ref). This playground demonstrates the 3d motion of the balls shot out from the source located above the ground surface. Projectile dynamics take into account the pitch angle and the height of the source as well as the projectile velocity. After the user sets the parameters, the simulation generates a curved path, a combination of parabolas and straight lines, under the action of specified gravity. The introduced demo is a good start in studying ballistics and more complex problems such as the behaviour of the bullets, unguided bombs and rockets.

## User Interface

In the **Control Panel**, the user can adjust several simulation parameteres: 
1. Velocity
2. Pitch angle
3. Height
4. Gravity
