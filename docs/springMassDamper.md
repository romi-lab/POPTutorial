# Spring-Mass-Damper System

## Introduction
<br>

The mass-spring-damper system is one the best examples for beginners in modelling and control. Spring stiffness, friction and object mass account for the dynamics, and external force is the control input. Also, a PID controller is presented, which serves as a solid introduction to control loops with feedback mechanisms. By tuning the parameters of the PID controller and the spring, users can study the behaviour of the system and its performance in achieving the target position.
